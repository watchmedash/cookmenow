<b>For the Pie Crust:</b>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water</li>
</ul>
<b>For the Apple Filling:</b>
<ul>
<li>6 cups thinly sliced and peeled apples (such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp)</li>
<li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, diced</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<b>For the Pie Crust:</b>
<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and granulated sugar.</li>
<li>Add the chilled and cubed unsalted butter to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to cut the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
<li>Sprinkle ice water, a few tablespoons at a time, over the flour-butter mixture. Gently mix the dough until it comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into two equal portions, flatten each into a disk, and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
</ol>
<b>For the Apple Filling:</b>
<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the thinly sliced and peeled apples, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and salt. Toss the mixture until the apples are well coated.</li>
<li>Sprinkle all-purpose flour over the apple mixture and toss again to combine.</li>
</ol>
<b>For Assembling:</b>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the chilled pie crust into a circle that fits your pie dish. Carefully transfer the crust to the dish and press it gently into the bottom and sides.</li>
<li>Add the apple filling into the pie crust and distribute it evenly.</li>
<li>Dot the top of the filling with diced unsalted butter.</li>
<li>Roll out the second portion of the chilled pie crust and place it over the apple filling. Trim the excess dough and crimp the edges to seal the pie.</li>
<li>Make a few slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
<li>Optionally, brush the top crust with milk or egg wash for a golden finish.</li>
<li>Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until the crust is golden and the apple filling is bubbly.</li>
<li>Allow the pie to cool for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Preparation Time: 30 minutes (plus chilling time for pie crust)</li>
<li>Cooking Time: 45-50 minutes</li>
<li>Total Time: 75-80 minutes (plus chilling time)</li>
</ul>
