<ul>
<li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cooked and cubed</li>
<li>1/3 cup butter</li>
<li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon dried sage</li>
<li>1 3/4 cups chicken broth</li>
<li>2/3 cup milk</li>
<li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
<li>1 cup frozen carrots</li>
<li>1/2 cup frozen corn</li>
<li>1 package refrigerated pie crusts (2 crusts)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour, salt, black pepper, thyme, and sage until well combined to form a roux.</li>
<li>Gradually add the chicken broth and milk to the roux, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes until the sauce becomes creamy.</li>
<li>Add the cooked and cubed chicken, frozen peas, carrots, and corn to the sauce. Stir well to combine.</li>
<li>Remove the saucepan from the heat.</li>
<li>Unroll one pie crust and place it in the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish. Press the crust to fit the dish and trim any excess dough.</li>
<li>Pour the chicken mixture into the pie dish over the crust.</li>
<li>Unroll the second pie crust and place it over the filling. Press the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal, and flute the edges if desired.</li>
<li>Using a sharp knife, make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
<li>Bake the Chicken Pot Pie in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Preparation Time: 20 minutes</li>
<li>Cooking Time: 30-35 minutes</li>
<li>Total Time: 50-55 minutes</li>
</ul>
