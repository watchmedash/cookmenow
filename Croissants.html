      <img src="images/Croissants.jpg" alt="Croissants" />

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
          <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
          <li>1/2 cup cold milk</li>
          <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
          <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and active dry yeast.</li>
          <li>Add the cold cubed butter to the flour mixture and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until you have coarse crumbs.</li>
          <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the cold milk and cold water. Mix until the dough starts to come together.</li>
          <li>Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
          <li>Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
          <li>After chilling, take the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it into a rectangle on a floured surface. Fold the dough into thirds (like a letter) and then roll it out again.</li>
          <li>Repeat the folding and rolling process two more times, then cover the dough and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
          <li>Take the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and roll it into a large rectangle. Cut the dough into triangles.</li>
          <li>Starting from the wide end, roll each triangle tightly towards the tip to form a croissant shape.</li>
          <li>Place the croissants on the prepared baking sheet and brush them with the beaten egg for a shiny finish.</li>
          <li>Bake the croissants for 15-18 minutes or until they turn golden brown and flaky.</li>
          <li>Remove the croissants from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Time</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Preparation Time: 20 minutes</li>
          <li>Resting Time: 1 hour (chilling) + 30 minutes (after shaping)</li>
          <li>Baking Time: 15-18 minutes</li>
          <li>Total Time: Approximately 2 hours (including chilling and baking)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Facts about Croissants</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Croissants are a classic French pastry known for their buttery and flaky texture.</li>
          <li>The process of making croissants involves laminating the dough with layers of butter, which creates the signature flakiness.</li>
          <li>Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with sweet or savory fillings, such as chocolate, almond paste, or ham and cheese.</li>
          <li>They are typically served for breakfast or as a snack, and are often paired with coffee or hot chocolate.</li>
          <li>The word "croissant" means "crescent" in French, which describes the shape of this delightful pastry.</li>
          <li>Croissants are believed to have originated in Austria and were introduced to France in the 19th century.</li>
          <li>Authentic croissants are made with high-quality butter, which contributes to their rich and luxurious taste.</li>
          <li>While making croissants from scratch requires time and effort, the result is well worth it, as freshly baked croissants are incredibly delicious.</li>
          <li>There are many variations of croissants, including almond croissants, pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants), and ham and cheese croissants.</li>
          <li>Enjoy your homemade croissants warm and flaky for the best experience!</li>
