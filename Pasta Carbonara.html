<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 ounces (340g) spaghetti or fettuccine</li>
<li>4 ounces (115g) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced (optional)</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, minced garlic (if using), and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale over medium heat until crispy and golden brown. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li>When the pasta is cooked, reserve a cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot.</li>
<li>Immediately pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to coat the strands evenly. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.</li>
<li>If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add a small amount of the reserved pasta cooking water until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
<li>Add the cooked pancetta or guanciale to the pasta and toss again to combine.</li>
<li>Season with salt to taste (the pancetta or guanciale is already salty, so be careful with the additional salt).</li>
<li>Garnish the Pasta Carbonara with chopped fresh parsley and a final sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
<li>Serve immediately while the pasta is hot and creamy, enjoying the rich and comforting flavors of this classic Italian dish.</li>
