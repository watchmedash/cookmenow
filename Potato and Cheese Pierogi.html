<h1>Potato and Cheese Pierogi</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
<li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>1 cup mashed potatoes</li>
<li>1 cup farmer's cheese or ricotta cheese</li>
<li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, for sautéing</li>
<li>Sour cream and chopped chives, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg, sour cream, and melted butter. Mix until the dough comes together.</li>
<li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, farmer's cheese or ricotta cheese, and chopped onion (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut circles using a cookie cutter or a drinking glass.</li>
<li>Place a small spoonful of the potato-cheese filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Press the edges firmly to seal.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pierogi in batches for about 5 minutes or until they float to the surface. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain.</li>
<li>In a skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the boiled pierogi and sauté until lightly browned on both sides.</li>
<li>Serve the Potato and Cheese Pierogi hot with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped chives on top.</li>
