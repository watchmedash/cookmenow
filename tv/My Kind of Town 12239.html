    <h2>My Kind of Town</h2>
    <p>My Kind of Town is an American television game show that premiered on August 14, 2005 on ABC. Part variety show, part game show, the series brings 200 people from a small town in the United States to New York City to compete for prizes and participate in games and assorted gags. At the end of the show, one of the 200 who was preselected prior to the show competes in a game called "Name Your Neighbors" where, if the person is successful in identifying the names of six people featured in the program, the entire audience wins a prize.

The show is hosted by English television and radio presenter Johnny Vaughan. The show's executive producer is Michael Davies, who is also the producer of the American version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

Despite a lead-in of reruns from ABC's popular Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and a lead-out of reruns from the also-popular Desperate Housewives, the show's ratings were dismal, with the premiere episode receiving just a 2.9 rating among 18-49 viewers, with about 11.4 million viewers. By the third episode, the show received a 2.1 rating, with about 5.1 million viewers. The show has received very little in-network advertising. Only four of seven episodes had aired when ABC canceled the show.</p>
